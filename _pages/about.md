##I am an Actinide Chemistry PhD student at Notre Dame conducting research in environmental actinide chemistry, employing aqueous chemistry and synchrotron x-ray spectroscopy techniques
# Academic and Research Experience
Currently, I study plutonium sorption and reduction behavior at the mineral-water interface as a function of mineral complexity.

I received a Bachelor in Science degree in Geology from Cal Poly Pomona in 2019. While working on my B.Sc., I conducted environmental geochemistry research at Chapman University from 2017 to  2019 studying Arsenic speciation using synchrotron X-ray techniques. I also participated in two REUs: one at Chapman University in 2016 and later at Stanford Univeristy in 2018.

# Leadership Experience
I have served as president of the Geology Club at Santiago Canyon College and Cal Poly Pomona. I have also served as a mentor to an undergraduate student applying to graduate programs. I have grown increasingly passionate about connecting science with campus and local communities.

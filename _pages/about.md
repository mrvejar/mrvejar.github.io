# About me
I am a PhD student at Notre Dame conducting research in environmental actinide geochemistry, employing primarily low-temperature aqueous chemistry and geochemistry, and synchrotron x-ray spectroscopy techniques. 

Chiefly, I use this page to introduce myself and direct you to my professional pages and facilitating getting in contact with me. Click the relevant icon(s) on the left in Desktop view.

# Academic and Research Experience
Currently, I study Plutonium sorption and reduction behavior in the environment at the mineral-water interface of iron oxides as a function of mineral complexity.

I received a Bachelor in Science degree in Geology from Cal Poly Pomona in 2019. While working on my B.Sc., I conducted environmental geochemistry research at Chapman University from 2017 to  2019 studying Arsenic speciation using synchrotron X-ray techniques. 

I also participated in two REUs: one at Chapman University in 2016 studying nanoparticle aggregation and its impact on sorption behavior, and later at Stanford Univeristy in 2018 studying sedimentary geology using geochemistry and geochronology.

# Leadership Experience
Co-author, co-organizer, and one of 3 graduate mentors for UROC Readiness program; a community-oriented college preparation and research experience program in partnership with ND TRiO, ND Energy, Self-Healing Communities SB, and South Bend Community School Corporation. My co-organizers/co-mentors (grad students Frances Zengotita and Virginia Rodriguez) and I have been mentoring 2 absolutely brilliant and hard-working high school mentees from Washington HS in South Bend, IN. We look forward to work with them in more thrilling experiments and analyses, and we are excited to continue to mentor them through the rest of the calendar year. 

Earlier in my carrer, I have served as president of the Geology Club at Santiago Canyon College and Cal Poly Pomona. I have also served as a mentor to two  undergraduate students applying to graduate programs through Cientifico Latino. I have grown increasingly passionate about connecting science with campus and local communities.

I am also interested in becoming more involved with the synchrotron user community and in working towards increasing access to state-of-the-art scientific facilities to underserved communities and minority-serving institutions.

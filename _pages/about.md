# About me
I am an Actinide Chemistry PhD student at Notre Dame conducting research in environmental actinide chemistry, employing aqueous chemistry and synchrotron x-ray spectroscopy techniques. 

Primarily, I use this page to introduce myself and direct you to my professional sites and facilitating getting in contact with me. Click the relevant icon(s) on the left.

To see posters and other research-related items, visit my ResearchGate by clicking the RG link on the left.

# Academic and Research Experience
Currently, I study Plutonium sorption and reduction behavior at the mineral-water interface as a function of mineral complexity.

I received a Bachelor in Science degree in Geology from Cal Poly Pomona in 2019. While working on my B.Sc., I conducted environmental geochemistry research at Chapman University from 2017 to  2019 studying Arsenic speciation using synchrotron X-ray techniques. I also participated in two REUs: one at Chapman University in 2016 and later at Stanford Univeristy in 2018.

# Leadership Experience
I have served as president of the Geology Club at Santiago Canyon College and Cal Poly Pomona. I have also served as a mentor to an undergraduate student applying to graduate programs. I have grown increasingly passionate about connecting science with campus and local communities.
